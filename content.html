        <p>What? Alright, good-bye Liny. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Thank you. In about thirty years. The storm.
        But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record
        company. It's like Doc's always saying.</p>
        <p>You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me
        give you the number. Bye. Marty. Marty. Marty. No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're
        strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your
        line, George. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too.</p>
        <p>Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or
        something? Wrecked? Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet. Doc.
        What Lorraine, what?</p>
        <p>Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on
        the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porcel was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I
        came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible.
        The flux capacitor. The storm. No, Biff, you leave her alone. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in
        hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid.</p>
        <p>Alright, punk, now- Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Okay, real mature guys. Okay,
        Biff, will you pick up my books? Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. You're George McFly.</p>
        <p>No. Huh? Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over
        the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. You're gonna be in the car with her. What, what, ma?</p>
